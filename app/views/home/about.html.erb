  In the book ‘Outliers’, the author Malcolm Gladwell mentions the <span class="text1">‘10,000-Hour Rule’</span>, claiming that the key to achieving world class expertise in any skill is, to a large extent, a matter of practicing the correct way, for a total of around 10,000 hours.

  The 10,000 hour rule was developed by Anders Ericsson (a Professor at the University of Colorado) in 1993. His paper called ‘The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance’ highlighted the work of a group of psychologists in Berlin, who had studied the practice habits of violin students in childhood, adolescence and adulthood.
